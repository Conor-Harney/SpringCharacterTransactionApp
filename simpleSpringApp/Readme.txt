The feature set herein represent a minimal viable product of a command line interface for purchasing characters in a video game type scenario. Please note, the product is not finished as per the specification: 
	Do not complete the code. Leave approximately 15-20 mins of coding. 
Note I have chosen the junit tests as the final 20 minutes of this product. I have put in a the class that will run a life-cycle test, but I have not populated it. 

The source code can be run in an IDE or you can use the bat provided to build and run the jar. 

The instructions can be read on screen in the application, but to clarify: 
Happy path: 
User creates an account. 
User tops up account.
User purchases one or more characters. 
User lists all their characters.
 
Note: 
Users must have an account before they can add a character. 
A new account does not have any currency. 
When entering a currency amount, currency symbols (€,£,$ etc) are not necessary.
